[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/dbsystel/playground)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/dbsystel/playground)

This is the DB Systel playground. A safe space for getting experience with contributing to open source software, how pull requests work and all that, on example code. Be creative but don't put anything with real value here. You'll get friendly review, and since this is not production code you can't break anything anyway.

There is a `src` directory with code, "Hello, World!" examples in a couple of programming languages. There are many ways how these can be improved. Feel free to submit pull requests with what you would change or add.

## How to contribute

See the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details how to contribute. Here are some examples of what you could do:

* Add a "Hello, World!" in another programming language
* Extend one of the existing examples to add a new feature (here you need to be creative, what could a new feature for "Hello, World!" be?)
* Report a bug by opening a GitHub issue
* Write a test for one of the examples
* Port an example to another platform where it doesn't work yet
* Add some documentation
* ...

## Contributers-App

We have a simple contributers-app in this repository, made with react.js in javascript.
You can add yourself with some info about you :-)

To start the app you need node.js and npm to be installed.
Open a terminal, navigate to the root of your repo-clone and type:
`npm run contributers-app`

## Hacktoberfest 2019

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a global celebration of open source software encouraging everyone to make positive contributions to the every growing open source community. Everyone is welcome to participate.

Feel free to use this repository to hone your skills in making pull requests.

There is a [Hacktoberfest Frankfurt 2019](https://hacktoberffm.de/) event on October 18, hosted by DB Systel in the Silver Tower in Frankfurt. Join us there to hear about open source in person, get to know others from the community, talk about projects, or to get help with making your first pull request. It will be fun.
