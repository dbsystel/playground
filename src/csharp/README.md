This is the DB Systel playground. A safe space for getting experience with contributing to open source software, how pull requests work and all that, on example code. Be creative but don't put anything with real value here. You'll get friendly review, and since this is not production code you can't break anything anyway.

There is a `src` directory with code, "Hello, World!" examples in a couple of programming languages. There are many ways how these can be improved. Feel free to submit pull requests with what you would change or add.
